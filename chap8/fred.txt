Fred Flintstone is the main character of the animated sitcom The Flintstones,
which aired during prime-time on ABC during the original series' run from 
1960 to 1966.[28] Fred is the husband of Wilma Flintstone and father of Pebbles 
Flintstone and together the family live in their homely cave in the town of Bedrock.
His best friend is his next door neighbor, Barney, who has a wife named Betty and 
an adopted son, named Bamm-Bamm.

Fred lives in the fictional prehistoric town of Bedrock, a world where dinosaurs 
coexist with modernized cavepeople and the cavepeople enjoy "primitive" versions 
of modern conveniences such as telephones, automobiles, and washing machines. Fred's
trademark catchphrase yell is "yabba dabba doo!", a phrase that was originally his 
club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on 
and used in the 1994 live-action Flintstones movie.

Since the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon 
spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and commercials.
