# Write a program that reads a series of words (with one word per line)
# until end-of-input, then prints a summary of how many times each word 
# was seen. (Hint: remember that when an undefined value is used as if 
# it were a number, Perl automatically converts it to 0. It may help to 
# look back at the earlier exercise that kept a running total.) So, if 
# the input words were fred, barney, fred, dino, wilma, fred (all on separate lines),
# the output should tell us that fred was seen 3 times. For extra credit,
# sort the summary words in code point order in the out‚Äê put.
